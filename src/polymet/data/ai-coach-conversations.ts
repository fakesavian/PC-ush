Repeat 3-4 times before bed.\n\n3. Visualization: Imagine yourself in a peaceful, safe place like a beach or forest. Engage all your senses - what do you see, hear, smell, and feel in this place?\n\nWould you like me to guide you through one of these techniques now?",

Try the Pomodoro Technique: Work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. After 4 cycles, take a longer 15-30 minute break.\n\n2. Use implementation intentions: Instead of saying "I\'ll work on my project today," say "At 10am, I\'ll sit at my desk and work on my project for 1 hour."\n\n3. Make tasks smaller: Break down large tasks into smaller, more manageable steps.\n\n4. Remove distractions: Put your phone in another room, use website blockers, or work in a quiet environment.\n\nWhich of these would you like to explore further?',

One-pot or sheet pan meals: Throw protein, vegetables, and a starch on a sheet pan with olive oil and seasonings. Roast at 400Â°F for about 20-30 minutes.\n\n3. Healthy convenience foods: Stock up on pre-washed salad greens, canned beans, frozen vegetables, rotisserie chicken, and pre-cooked grains.\n\n4. Simple formula meals: Follow the template of protein + vegetable + healthy carb for balanced meals without recipes.\n\nWould you like specific quick recipe ideas or more meal prep tips?",
